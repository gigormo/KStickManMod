# KStickManMod

This is a simple BepInEx(v6.0.0-pre.1+) mod for [Stickman Strikes: Conquer Fantasy World](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2924170/Stickman_Strikes_Conquer_Fantasy_World/)

The only functionality is to change the games Timescale anywhere. Though I didn't really test it, I'm not sure if all the games functions utilize unitys built in timescale.

If you want to build it as with all my unity mods you'll need to fix the references and it should work out of the box. This mod is using an assetbundle I created in the unity engine(Version 2021.3? Its the version the game used...)
